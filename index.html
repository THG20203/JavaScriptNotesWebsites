    <!-- VALUES AND VARIABLES SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>VALUES AND VARIABLES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A value = piece of data, fundamental piece of information.</li>
        <li>Value = smallest unit of information.</li>
        <li>
          Values can be stored into variables, process is called declaring the
          variable - i.e. let firstName = "Jonas";
        </li>
        <li>Outputting code to the browser = done into the console.log.</li>
        <li>
          You pass the variable name console.log(firstName); into console. A
          Syntax error is error in writing the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable names can't start with numbers. Variable names can only
          contain numbers, letters or dollar sign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also can't use reserved keywords let new = 27; 'New' is a reserved
          keyword In javascript, don't start variable name with upper case
          letter.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- DATA TYPES -->
    <section>
      <h2>DATA TYPES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every value is an object or a primitive. Values are only a primitive
          if they are not an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example of an object:
          <br />let me = { <br />
          name: "Jonas; <br />
          }
        </li>
        <li>
          Example of primitive: <br />
          let firstName= "Tristan"; <br />
          let age = 30; */
        </li>
        <li>
          7 Primitive data types:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Number - floating point (meaning always have decimals, even if we
              don't see them or define them). Number are used for decimals and
              integers.
            </li>
            <li>String - sequence of characters used for text.</li>
            <li>
              Boolean - logical type that can only be true or false. It is used
              for taking decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Undefined - value taken by a variable that is not yet defined -
              empty value.
            </li>
            <li>Null - also means 'empty value'</li>
            <li>
              Symbol - (ES2015) - unique and cannot be changed (not useful now)
            </li>
            <li>
              BigInt - (ES2020) - larger integars than number type can hold
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript has dynamic typing - we do not have to manually define data
          type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are
          determined automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript - value has a type. NOT the variable. Variables simply
          store a value that has as type.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dynamic typing - we can assign a new value in a different data type to
          the same variable without a problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: <br/ >Variable x can initially be a number then later a
          string. Can be useful but also difficult to find bugs.
        </li>
        <li>Boolean is true or false.</li>
        <li>
          Just writing 'true' is a boolean value - i.e. console.log(true). It is
          not a string cause printed in pink rather than white as a string would
          be printed in within the console.
        </li>
        <li>We can store booleans in variables. let javascriptIsFun = true;</li>
        <li>
          Remember, variable declaration needs to happen before the log, because
          javascript is executed from top to bottom
          console.log(javascriptIsFun);
        </li>
        <li>
          In dynamic typing, what matters is that we do not write the let again.
          <br />
          let javascriptIsFun = true;<br />
          javascriptIsFun = "YES!";
        </li>
        <li>
          First time we declare a new varaible, we need to do it using let. But
          then, when we want to change the value - of the varaible, we simply
          write it again without the let.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- LET, CONST AND VAR -->
    <section>
      <h2>LET, CONST AND VAR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Three ways of declaring variables in JavaScript -> let, const and var
        </li>
        <li>let + const introduced ES6 -> modern JS. var is old way.</li>
        <li>
          let keyword -> declare variables that will change later, during the
          execution of our program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shown example of let - reassigning value to a variable<br />let age =
          30;<br />
          age = 31;
        </li>
        <li>
          Use const - declare variables that are not supposed to change at any
          point in the future. Value in const variable cannot be changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Below WON'T work:<br />
          const birthYear = 1991;<br />
          birthYear = 1990;
        </li>
        <li>This procudes another kind of javascript error, a TypeError.</li>
        <li>
          The fact that variables created with const are immutable also means we
          cannot declare empty const variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          const job; produces -> Syntax error: missing initializer in const
          declaration.
        </li>
        <li>
          We should use const by default, let if things will change in the
          future. Good to have as little mutations as possible, because changing
          varialbes introduces potential for bugs.
        </li>
        <li>let is blockscoped, var is function scoped</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- BASIC OPERATORS -->
    <section>
      <h2>BASIC OPERATORS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Operators allows us to transfer values or combine multiple values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Categories of operators -> mathematical, comparison, logical,
          assignment
        </li>
        <li>
          Mathematical operator -> use minus operator to solve simple problem.
          <br />
          const ageJonas = 2037 - 1991;
        </li>
        <li>2 ** 3 means 2 to the power of 3 = 2 * 2 * 2</li>
        <li>
          Another use case for plus operator is to join strings (concatenate)
          <br />
          const firstName = "Tristan";<br />
          const lastName = "Griffiths";
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a space? add empty stringconsole.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
        </li>
        <li>
          Assignment Operators. Most simple is = equals<br />
          let x = 10 + 5;
        </li>
        <li>
          In above code x will be assinged 15, because the + operator is
          executed before the assignment operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further assignment operators:<br />
          x += 10; IS x = x + 10;<br />
          x = x + 1; IS x++;<br />
          x = x - 1; IS x--; <br />
          x = x - 1; IS x--;
        </li>
        <li>
          > greater <br />
          < less than<br />
          >= greater equal<br />
          <= less than equal
          <br />
          LEFT TO RIGHT - hence x > y means x is greater than y
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- STATEMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS -->
    <section>
      <h2>STATEMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Expression = piece of code that produces a value -> i.e. 3 +
            4</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Boolean code will also produce a value<br />
          true && false && !false;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Statements = piece of code executed doesn't produce piece of value
            on itself
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          This if else statment below doesn't produce a value does it? All it
          does is declares variable called str <br />if (23 > 10) { <br />const
          str = "23 is bigger"; <br />}
        </li>
        <li>
          Template literal -> only insert expressions not statements. i.e. 2037
          - 1991 as shown below
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- THE CONDITIONAL (TERNARY) OPERATOR -->

      <h2>THE CONDITIONAL (TERNARY) OPERATOR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>const drink = age >= 18 ? "wine" : "water";</li>
        <li>Can put ternary operator into a template literal</li>
        <li>
          Cause ternary operator is asn EXPRESSION that produces a VALUE */
          console.log(`I like to drink ${age >= 18 ? "wine" : "water"}`);
