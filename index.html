    <!-- VALUES AND VARIABLES SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>VALUES AND VARIABLES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A value = piece of data, fundamental piece of information.</li>
        <li>Value = smallest unit of information.</li>
        <li>
          Values can be stored into variables, process is called declaring the
          variable - i.e. let firstName = "Jonas";
        </li>
        <li>Outputting code to the browser = done into the console.log.</li>
        <li>
          You pass the variable name console.log(firstName); into console. A
          Syntax error is error in writing the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Variable names can't start with numbers. Variable names can only
          contain numbers, letters or dollar sign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also can't use reserved keywords let new = 27; 'New' is a reserved
          keyword In javascript, don't start variable name with upper case
          letter.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- DATA TYPES -->
    <section>
      <h2>DATA TYPES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every value is an object or a primitive. Values are only a primitive
          if they are not an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example of an object:
          <br />let me = { <br />
          name: "Jonas; <br />
          }
        </li>
        <li>
          Example of primitive: <br />
          let firstName= "Tristan"; <br />
          let age = 30; */
        </li>
        <li>
          7 Primitive data types:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Number - floating point (meaning always have decimals, even if we
              don't see them or define them). Number are used for decimals and
              integers.
            </li>
            <li>String - sequence of characters used for text.</li>
            <li>
              Boolean - logical type that can only be true or false. It is used
              for taking decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Undefined - value taken by a variable that is not yet defined -
              empty value.
            </li>
            <li>Null - also means 'empty value'</li>
            <li>
              Symbol - (ES2015) - unique and cannot be changed (not useful now)
            </li>
            <li>
              BigInt - (ES2020) - larger integars than number type can hold
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript has dynamic typing - we do not have to manually define data
          type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are
          determined automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript - value has a type. NOT the variable. Variables simply
          store a value that has as type.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dynamic typing - we can assign a new value in a different data type to
          the same variable without a problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: <br/ >Variable x can initially be a number then later a
          string. Can be useful but also difficult to find bugs.
        </li>
        <li>Boolean is true or false.</li>
        <li>
          Just writing 'true' is a boolean value - i.e. console.log(true). It is
          not a string cause printed in pink rather than white as a string would
          be printed in within the console.
        </li>
        <li>We can store booleans in variables. let javascriptIsFun = true;</li>
        <li>
          Remember, variable declaration needs to happen before the log, because
          javascript is executed from top to bottom
          console.log(javascriptIsFun);
        </li>
        <li>
          In dynamic typing, what matters is that we do not write the let again.
          <br />
          let javascriptIsFun = true;<br />
          javascriptIsFun = "YES!";
        </li>
        <li>
          First time we declare a new varaible, we need to do it using let. But
          then, when we want to change the value - of the varaible, we simply
          write it again without the let.
        </li>
      </ul>
